## How to run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — game server
cd server && npm run dev     # Colyseus on port 5001

# Terminal 2 — client
npm run dev                  # Vite on port 5000
```

Both are also configured as Replit workflows:
- **"Start application"** → `npm run dev` (port 5000, webview)
- **"Colyseus server"** → `cd server && npm run dev` (port 5001, console)

## Gameplay (Freeplay mode)

- **WASD / Arrow keys** — move
- **E** — interact with nearby task or press emergency button
- **R** — report a dead body
- **M** — toggle mini-map
- **Touch** — virtual joystick (bottom-left zone only, so it doesn't steal taps meant for the action buttons)

Complete **8 tasks** before the impostor bot kills enough crewmates to win.

## Sabotage

The impostor's second tool (alongside kill): 5 types — **Lights** (crews' vision collapses to `CREW_VISION_SABOTAGED`; impostor vision unaffected), **Comms** (task list/compass hidden), **Doors** (2 random tasks locked for `DOORS_LOCK_MS`, no manual fix — just expires), **Reactor**/**O2** (critical — impostor wins outright if not fixed within `CRITICAL_SABOTAGE_MS`). One sabotage active at a time; `SABOTAGE_COOLDOWN_MS` cooldown starts the moment it's *triggered*, not when it resolves. Lights/Comms auto-clear after `SABOTAGE_SAFETY_MS` if nobody fixes them. Fix panels reuse the existing `AMBIENT_CENTRES` room-centre points (no new map data invented) — walk into the room and press **E**.

- **Multiplayer**: fully server-authoritative — `server/rooms/AmongGasRoom.ts` (`handleSabotage`/`handleSabotageFix`/`onSabotageTimeout`), state replicated via `GameRoomState.sabotageType/sabotageEndsAt/sabotageLockedTasks`. Impostor player triggers via a HUD button + type menu (`GameScene.buildSabotageMenu`); everyone sees a top banner (`buildSabotageBanner`).
- **Freeplay**: same rules, driven client-side since there's no server — the bot impostor rolls a sabotage chance every 10s once off cooldown (`GameScene.impostorSabotageAI` → `triggerBotSabotage`/`onSabotageTimeoutLocal`/`clearSabotageLocal`/`fixSabotageLocal`). All the shared systems (fog, task list, door-lock markers, banner) read the same `sabotageType`/`sabotageEndsAt`/`sabotageLockedTasks` fields regardless of mode, so they needed no duplication — only the trigger/fix source differs (network message vs. local AI/interact).
- Constants mirrored between `src/settings.ts` and `server/rooms/AmongGasRoom.ts` — keep both in sync if tuning durations.
- **Not implemented**: Venting (impostor-only vent network traversal) — see follow-up task.

## User preferences

- Port the Python/Pygame game to TypeScript + Phaser 3
- Target Telegram HTML5 Mini App (touch + keyboard)
- Preserve all original game logic, visuals, and assets exactly
- Single entry point (`index.html`), TypeScript modules via Vite

## Project setup notes

- This repo also contains the original Python/Pygame source (`main.py`, `board.py`, `server.py`, etc.) kept for reference — the active, maintained version is the TypeScript/Phaser web port under `src/`.
- Workflow "Start application" runs `npm run dev` (Vite on port 5000).
- Workflow "Colyseus server" runs `cd server && npm run dev` (Colyseus on port 5001).
- **IMPORTANT**: `colyseus` (server-only package) must ONLY be in `server/package.json`. Installing it in the root `package.json` breaks Vite's rollup native binary (uWebSockets is blocked by Replit security policy, causing `--omit=optional` to strip rollup's native binary too). Root uses only `@colyseus/sdk` (browser client). See `.agents/memory/colyseus-0.17-replit-setup.md`.

## Mobile portrait + Telegram Mini App adaptation — DONE

Goal: adapt the desktop/landscape web port for mobile **portrait** play (Telegram Mini App), with a virtual joystick, contextual action buttons, and full Telegram SDK integration.

### Done
- **Base resolution**: fixed portrait `750×1334` design resolution (`src/settings.ts` `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`, `src/main.ts` Phaser config), `Scale.FIT` + `CENTER_BOTH`. Deliberately **not** changed to match real device pixels — every HUD element (fonts, icon sizes, button dimensions, camera zoom) is hand-tuned in literal pixels against this fixed resolution; changing the internal resolution breaks all of that sizing at once. Any future work must keep this constraint in mind.
- **Camera zoom**: `CAMERA_ZOOM` constant in `src/settings.ts` (currently `1.45`) applied to the main camera in `GameScene.create()` for a tighter mobile framing.
- **Dual-camera HUD fix**: `setScrollFactor(0)` alone does not protect HUD objects from camera zoom/rotation in Phaser 3. Added a second unzoomed `uiCamera` (`GameScene.setupUiCamera()`) — main camera `.ignore()`s all HUD objects, `uiCamera` ignores everything else. Any HUD-layer object created dynamically later needs its own explicit `this.cameras.main.ignore(...)` call at creation time.
- **HUD repositioning**: virtual joystick bottom-left; Emergency Meeting button top-left; Kill/Report/Use as circular touch-target buttons at bottom-left, contextually shown/hidden via `detectNearby()`. Mini-map button top-right.
- **Image aspect-ratio bug fixed**: `src/utils/imageFit.ts` (`fitContain`/`fitCover`) applied across `MenuScene.ts`, `GameScene.ts`, `VictoryScene.ts`.
- **Task compass arrows**: one arrow per incomplete task, edge-hugging radar for off-screen tasks, hovering near on-screen tasks.
- **Letterbox/pillarbox black bars**: kept `Scale.FIT` and blended the bar area into the game's dark space palette via CSS radial-gradient on `html, body` (`index.html`).
- **Telegram SDK bootstrap** (`src/main.ts`): `ready()`, `expand()`, `disableVerticalSwipes()`. Safe-area insets read once at game start, applied to HUD offsets.

### Still not started (portrait/mobile work)
1. `MeetingScene.ts` — convert to single-column voter list for portrait
2. Task mini-scenes (`src/scenes/tasks/*.ts`) — resize/reposition for portrait touch
3. `viewportChanged` — Telegram SDK viewport-resize event not wired (insets read once at boot only)
4. Final verification on a real phone

## Multiplayer — ALL PHASES COMPLETE ✅

All four multiplayer phases are implemented, TypeScript-clean, and verified by a headless integration test (`sim/mp-test.mjs`, 67/67 checks, ~100 s runtime).

### What's working

| Phase | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Infrastructure | Colyseus 0.17 server (port 5001), room schema, Telegram auth (bypassed in dev), lobby UI with 6-char room code and player list |
| 2 — Position sync | `RemotePlayer.ts` sprites; 10 Hz MOVE messages; server-side speed validation with POSITION_CORRECTION; linear interpolation on client |
| 3 — Full game events | All gameplay events server-driven: kills (KILL_CONFIRMED), tasks (TASK_DONE), meetings (MEETING_STARTED), votes (VOTE_RESULT), win/loss (GAME_OVER). MeetingScene handles both freeplay and multiplayer init shapes |
| 4 — Telegram deep-link invite | `start_param` at boot or on Online click → skip menus, pre-fill name from Telegram `first_name`, auto-join room. Share button builds `t.me/<BOT>/play?startapp=<roomId>` link |

### Integration test

```bash
node sim/mp-test.mjs   # requires Colyseus server running on port 5001
```

Tests: lobby join/leave, crew win (4/8/15 players), impostor win via kills (4 players), emergency meeting + voting, speed-cheat detection.

### Key server files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `server/rooms/AmongGasRoom.ts` | Room logic: LOBBY→GAME→MEETING→RESULT, maxClients=15 |
| `server/schema/GameState.ts` | PlayerState, TaskState, GameRoomState |
| `server/auth/telegram.ts` | HMAC-SHA256 initData validator (bypassed when NODE_ENV=development) |

### Known bugs (low priority)
- Red player visor renders green (cosmetic, pre-existing)

### To activate Telegram deep-link in production
1. Create bot via BotFather, register Mini App URL, set `/play` command
2. Update `VITE_BOT_USERNAME` Replit env var to the real bot username
3. Deploy

### Vent system (impostors)
Impostors can enter, travel through, and exit vent networks. 14 vents across 4 isolated networks:
- **A**: Cafeteria ↔ Medbay ↔ Upper Engine (triangle — all three connect)
- **B**: Reactor ↔ Reactor(2) ↔ Security ↔ Electrical (chain)
- **C**: Lower Engine ↔ Storage ↔ Admin (chain)
- **D**: Weapons ↔ Navigation ↔ Cockpit ↔ Cockpit(2) (chain)

Client files: `src/scenes/GameScene.ts` (`enterVent`, `showVentOverlay`, `travelVent`, `exitVent`), `VENT_NETWORK` / `VENT_ROOM_NAMES` constants at top of GameScene.ts.
Server files: `server/rooms/AmongGasRoom.ts` — `ENTER_VENT`, `TRAVEL_VENT`, `EXIT_VENT` handlers; `VENT_NETWORK` / `VENT_POSITIONS` constants. `inVent` boolean added to `PlayerState` schema.

**UX**: A purple 🌀 VENT button appears when the impostor stands within `INTERACT_RADIUS` of a vent. While venting, a popup shows connected-vent options plus an Exit button. Player sprite is hidden (alpha 0); remote players' sprites also hidden via `RemotePlayer.setInVent()`. Meeting start auto-exits the vent. Movement is blocked server-side while `inVent=true`.

### Admin Table
`src/scenes/AdminTableScene.ts` — overlay launched (not started) over GameScene. Shows the minimap PNG with one coloured dot per player at their current room's centre position. Dead players: grey ✕. Players in vents: hidden. Freeplay reads `gameScene.player` + `gameScene.bots`; multiplayer reads `NetworkManager.room.state.players`.

Trigger: walk near `admin_btn1` or `admin_btn2` objects in the TMX (both near the Admin room, ~x3820–4070, y~1804–1807) and press E / tap the USE button.

### Fog of war — verification results
206 wall/table rects cover the full map (x 581→5753, y 13→2933). Key rooms all have wall coverage: Reactor 24 rects, Cockpit 20, Weapons 19, Storage 20, Electrical 8. The ray-cast shadow system is architecturally correct at all rooms (see `.agents/memory/fog-of-war.md` for implementation notes).

### What's NOT done yet
- `MeetingScene.ts` — still landscape layout; needs single-column portrait reflow for mobile
- Task mini-scenes — not yet resized/repositioned for portrait touch
- Telegram `viewportChanged` event not wired (safe-area insets read once at boot only)
- Two-tab manual smoke test — all events verified by headless test but not yet visually confirmed across two real browser tabs
- Vent: impostor bot AI does not use vents (only human impostors in multiplayer can vent)
- Admin Table: dots from multiple players in the same room slightly overlap (no stack offset)
